# Pikmin-Like Godot Project

A small Godot 4.x project that demonstrates basic Pikmin-style mechanics.

The player character can: spawn and dismiss Pikmin, interact with objects, throw pikmin, and the Pikmin have states (following, idle, gathering, etc).

## Features

* Third-Person Camera
* Smooth 3D movement and camera controls.
* Multiple camera angles and zoom levels (over-the-shoulder and bird’s-eye view).
* Pikmin AI States

```
# FOLLOWING: Pikmin moves alongside the player.
# WAITING: Pikmin stands in place (placeholder for future expansions).
# IDLE: Pikmin does nothing.
# GATHERING: Placeholder for resource/object gathering mechanics.
# THROW: Pikmin is thrown in an arc by the player.
```

### Pikmin Summoning / Dismissal

* Summon new Pikmin with a key press (currently bound to spawn_pikmin == P key).

* Dismiss all following Pikmin back to an idle state (currently bound to dismiss_squad == X or Y key).

### Interaction Zones Area3D

* Detects when the player enters/exits a zone.
* Toggles an interaction prompt (3D mesh or UI element) when inside the zone.
* Handles interactions (i.e., opening a door, starting dialogue, etc.).

## Relevant Code:
	
Player.gd
Inherits CharacterBody3D. Responsible for player movement, camera logic, spawning Pikmin, dismissing Pikmin, and handling interactions.

Pikmin.gd
Inherits CharacterBody3D. Implements a simple state machine for Pikmin behavior, including navigation using NavigationAgent3D.

InteractionZone.gd
Inherits Node3D. Uses an Area3D to detect when the player enters/exits the zone and triggers an interaction prompt.

PikminContainer and IdlePikminContainer
These are just organizational nodes in the scene that group active and idle Pikmin for easier management and separation.
